# Shortest Path Calculator
## An CLI application 
This repository contains an application that's wrapper around Floyd - Warshall algotithm.
The application has three build-in commands:
* /load @filename -- load a data set from file
* /calculate -- calculate all shortest paths and save it to cache
* /route @place_from @place_to -- show the shortest path
* /save -- save all routes to file
You can try it out on 'replit' --> https://replit.com/@daniilda/shortest-path-calculator#
